# Chitter API Front End
This project was a weekend challenge after 7 weeks at Makers. The aim was to build a front end for an existing "chitter" (sound familiar?) API. 

We were able to use any front end framework or library of our choosing. I chose React since I had never used it before. In hindsight, attempting to learn to Test-Drive React was a big undertaking. I managed to spike the code to the point where I was able to fetch "peeps" from the API, but spent too long trying to work out how to test the app. Nevertheless, I learnt a lot from this exercise, despite not completing the app. 

## How to Use
```
git clone https://github.com/joshnickson/chitter-api-frontend
npm install
npm start
```
